Client classes
==============

Here are some information about the ``Client`` and  the ``AsyncClient`` classes.

Instantiate a client
--------------------

A client needs at least an :class:`audible.Authenticator` at instantiation. The
following args and kwargs can be passed to the client instantiation:

* country_code (overrides the country code set in :class:`audible.Authenticator`)
* headers (will be bypassed to the underlying httpx client)
* timeout (will be bypassed to the underlying httpx client)
* response_callback (custom response preparation - read more below)
* all other kwargs (will be bypassed to the underlying httpx client)

Make API requests
-----------------

Both client classes have the following methods to send requests
to the external API:

- get
- post
- delete
- put

The external Audible API offers currently two API versions, `0.0` and 
`1.0`. The Client use the `1.0` by default. So both terms are equal::

   resp = client.get("library")
   resp = client.get("1.0/library")

Each query parameter can be written as a separate keyword argument or you can
merge them as a dict to the `params` keyword. So both terms are equal::

   resp = client.get("library", response_groups="...", num_results=20)
   resp = client.get(
       "library",
       params={
           "response_groups"="...",
           "num_results"=20
       }
   )

The external Audible API awaits a request body in JSON format. You have to
provide the body as a dict to the Client. The Client converts and sends them
in JSON style to the API. You can send them like so::

   resp = client.post(
       "wishlist",
       body={"asin": ASIN_OF_BOOK_TO_ADD}
   )

The Audible API responses are in JSON format. The client converts them to a
and output them as a Python dict.

.. note::

   For all known API endpoints take a look at :ref:`api_endpoints`.

Client responses
----------------

.. versionadded:: v0.8.0

   The ``response_callback`` kwarg to client __init__, get, post, delete and put methods.

By default requesting the API with the client get, post, delete and put methods
will call :func:`audible.client.raise_for_status` and try to convert
the response with :func:`audible.client.convert_response_content` to a Python dict,
which is finally returned.

If you want to implement your own response preparation, you can do::

   def own_response_callback(resp):
       return resp

   client = audible.Client(auth=..., response_callback=own_response_callback)

This will return the unprepared response (include headers).

Show/Change Marketplace
-----------------------

The currently selected marketplace can be shown with::
   
    client.marketplace

The marketplace can be changed with::

   client.switch_marketplace(COUNTRY_CODE)

Username/Userprofile
--------------------

To get the profile for the user, which authentication data are used you 
can do this::

   user_profile = client.get_user_profile()

   # or from an Authenticator instance
   auth.refresh_access_token()
   user_profile = auth.user_profile()

To get the username only::

   user_name = client.user_name

Switch User
-----------

If you work with multiple users you can do this::

   # instantiate 1st user
   auth = audible.Authenticator.from_file(FILENAME)

   # instantiate 2nd user
   auth2 = audible.Authenticator.from_file(FILENAME2)

   # instantiate client with 1st user
   client = audible.AudibleAPI(auth)
   print(client.user_name)

   # now change user with auth2
   client.switch_user(auth2)
   print(client.user_name)
   
   # optional set default marketplace from 2nd user
   client.switch_user(auth2, switch_to_default_marketplace=True)

Misc
----

The underlying Authenticator can be accessed via the `auth` attribute.

Authenticator classes
=====================

.. deprecated:: v0.5.0

   The ``LoginAuthenticator`` and the ``FileAuthenticator``

.. versionchanged:: v0.6.0

The ``LoginAuthenticator`` and the ``FileAuthenticator`` are removed from the
Audible package.

.. versionadded:: v0.5.0

   The :class:`Authenticator` with the  classmethods ``from_file`` and 
   ``from_login``

The :meth:`Authenticator.from_login` classmethod is used to authorize 
an user and then authenticate requests with the received data. The 
:meth:`Authenticator.from_file` classmethod is used to load
previous saved authentication data.

With an Authenticator you can:

- Save credentials to file with ``auth.to_file()``
- Deregister a previously registered device with ``auth.deregister_device()``.
- Refresh an access token from a previously registered device with 
  ``auth.refresh_access_token()``.
- Get user profile with ``auth.user_profile()``. Needs a valid access token.

To check if a access token is expired you can call::

   auth.access_token_expired

Or to check the time left before token expires::

   auth.access_token_expires

Activation Bytes
================

.. versionadded:: v0.4.0

   Get activation bytes

.. versionadded:: v0.5.0

   the ``extract`` param

To retrieve activation bytes an authentication :class:`Authenticator` is needed.

The Activation bytes can be obtained like so::

   activation_bytes = auth.get_activation_bytes()

   # the whole activation blob can fetched with
   auth.get_activation_bytes(extract=False)

The activation blob can be saved to file too::

   activation_bytes = auth.get_activation_bytes(FILENAME)

PDF Url
=======

PDF urls received by the Audible API don't work anymore. Authentication data
are missing in the provided link. As a workaround you can do::

   import audible
   import httpx
   
   asin = ASIN_FROM_BOOK
   auth = audible.Authenticator.from_file(...)  # or Authenticator.from_login
   tld = auth.locale.domain

   with httpx.Client(auth=auth) as client:
       resp = client.head(
            f"https://www.audible.{tld}/companion-file/{asin}"
       )
       url = resp.url

Decrypting license
==================

Responses from the :http:post:`/1.0/content/(string:asin)/licenserequest`
endpoint contains the encrypted license (voucher).

To decrypt the license response you can do::

   from audible.aescipher import decrypt_voucher_from_licenserequest
   
   auth = YOUR_AUTH_INSTANCE
   lr = RESPONSE_FROM_LICENSEREQUEST_ENPOINT
   dlr = decrypt_voucher_from_licenserequest(auth, lr)
